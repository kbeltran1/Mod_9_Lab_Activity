# Mod_9_Lab_Activity
These lab activities help to expand my knowledge on how while statements can be used in different ways within a program. Problem 1 uses while true statement to print a message infinitely because there are no conditions that stop it. The other three problems that create scenerios where while statments prints certain messages based on the conditions being met. Specifcally problems 2 prints a list and a counter after said list. Problem 3 takes inputs until the condtion of sum being over 100 is met and once this condition is met the sum and numbers used to reach sum is printed. Problem 4 uses a counter to run through numbers 0-50 and from all those numbers, numbers divisible by 10 are taken and appended into a list and is printed.
